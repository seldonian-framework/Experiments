Seldonian Experiments documentation
=============================================
Welcome to the documentation for the Seldonian Experiments library. This library is designed to help you evaluate the performance and safety of `Seldonian algorithms <http://aisafety.cs.umass.edu/overview.html>`_. The source code is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/seldonian-framework/Experiments>`_. 

This library makes heavy use of the `Seldonian Engine library <https://seldonian-framework.github.io/Engine>`_, the core library for running Seldonian algorithms. 

If you are completely new to this library, see the :doc:`overview`.
