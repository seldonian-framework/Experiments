# Steps to run this example:
# 1. Download raw data from here: https://github.com/seldonian-toolkit/Tutorials/raw/main/tutorial_j_materials/age_gender.zip, unzip it and put the csv file into a subfolder data/raw/ inside the headless_facial_gender/ example folder. This file is too big to host on github. 
# 2. Run the processing script: python process_data.py
# 3. Create the spec file, modifiying the constraint string or the epsilon if you want to run different constraints: python create_spec.py
